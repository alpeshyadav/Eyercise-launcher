### Eyercise
Having a good eyesight in current times after being exposed to harmful blue light from computer screens is indeed a blessing! Isn't it? Scientists have proved that doing small eye-exercises or eye-yoga in regular intervals of time can help in keeping the eyes in good health. Eyercise helps you do exactly that!

Presenting Eyercise, a google extension that would remind you to de-strain your eyes and workout your eye muscles in equal intervals of time to keep you away from all eye-related issues.

## Features of Eyercise:
